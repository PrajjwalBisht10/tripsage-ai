# Troubleshooting

Debugging techniques, CI/CD information, and development workflow guidance.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Setup

TripSage uses minimal CI/CD with GitHub Actions for quality gates:

**Jobs:**

- **Frontend**: TypeScript checking, linting, unit tests

**Triggers:**

- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests to main/develop
- Changes to relevant file paths

### Quality Gates

```bash
# TypeScript checks
pnpm biome:check    # Lint and auto-fix
pnpm biome:fix      # Format code
pnpm type-check     # Type checking
pnpm test           # Run tests
```

### Path-Based Execution

CI jobs run only when relevant files change:

- Frontend: `src/**`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.
- Config: `.github/workflows/**`

## Branch Workflow

### Branch Types

**Main Branches:**

- `main`: Production code, requires PR reviews
- `develop`: Integration branch for features

**Feature Branches:**

- Pattern: `feat/*` (e.g., `feat/user-authentication`)
- Created from `develop`, merged back to `develop`

**Other Branches:**

- `session/*`: Temporary work branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Feature development
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feat/new-feature
# Work on feature
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"
git push origin feat/new-feature
# Create PR to develop, then PR from develop -> main when ready

# Release process (automated)
# Merge to main triggers semantic-release:
# - computes next version (feat/minor, fix/patch, breaking->minor while pre-stable)
# - updates CHANGELOG.md and package.json
# - tags and publishes a GitHub Release
```

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits:

```bash
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve database connection timeout
docs: update API documentation
refactor: simplify trip creation logic
```

Release automation expectations (semantic-release):

- Prefix with `feat:` for minor changes, `fix:` for patches; use other prefixes (`chore:`, `docs:`, `ci:`) for non-releasing work.
- For breaking changes, add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the commit body describing the impact.
- While we are pre-stable, breaking changes are **downgraded to minor bumps** by configuration; majors are intentionally suppressed until we flip to the first stable major.

## Debugging Techniques

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Problems

**Supabase Auth Errors:**

- Check Supabase dashboard logs
- Verify client credentials
- Confirm redirect URIs match
- Local dev email confirmations:
  - Supabase local is configured with Inbucket (sometimes shown as Mailpit in `pnpm supabase:status`); open `http://localhost:54324` and click the confirmation link instead of manually editing the database. See [Supabase runbook: Inbucket/Mailpit](../../runbooks/supabase.md#local-auth-email-confirmations-inbucket--mailpit).
  - If confirmations are enabled (`[auth.email].enable_confirmations = true`), new users must confirm before authenticated app flows work.
  - Only as a last resort (local-only), you can mark a user as confirmed via Supabase Studio or SQL; do not carry this habit to production environments.

#### Database Connection Issues

**Query Performance:**

```sql
-- Enable query logging
SET log_statement = 'all';
SET log_duration = 'on';

-- Check slow queries
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active' AND now() - query_start > interval '1 second';
```

### Frontend Debugging

**React Development Tools:**

- Use React DevTools for component inspection
- Check Network tab for API calls
- Monitor TanStack Query cache

**State Management:**

```typescript
// Debug Zustand state
 import { useAuthCore } from "@/stores/auth/auth-core";

// In component
const state = useAuthCore.getState();
console.log("Auth state:", state);
```

### Testing in Development

**Run targeted shards:**

```bash
pnpm test:affected
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:components
pnpm test:api
```

**Run a specific test file (Vitest):**

```bash
pnpm exec vitest src/stores/__tests__/auth/auth-core.test.ts
```

**Debug test failures / hangs:**

```bash
# Watch mode (note: `pnpm test` runs once)
pnpm exec vitest

# If Vitest hangs after finishing:
VITEST_DEBUG_OPEN_HANDLES=1 pnpm test
```

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization

**Query Analysis:**

```sql
-- Explain query execution
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM trips WHERE user_id = $1;

-- Check index usage
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE relname = 'trips';
```

### Caching Strategies

**Cache Invalidation:**

Cache invalidation is handled automatically by Next.js and Supabase. For manual cache clearing during development:

- Restart the development server to clear Next.js cache
- Use Supabase dashboard to clear database caches if needed

## Deployment Issues

### Container Problems

**Docker Build Issues:**

```bash
# Debug build process
docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t tripsage .

# Check container logs
docker logs tripsage-container
```

**Health Check Failures:**

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check container health
docker ps
docker inspect tripsage-container | grep -A 10 "Health"
```

### Environment Configuration

**Missing Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Check environment
env | grep -E "(SUPABASE|DATABASE|REDIS|AI_GATEWAY)"
```

**Configuration Conflicts:**

Compare environment variables across deployment environments using your deployment platform's configuration management.

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Application Metrics

**Response Times:**

- API endpoints: target <500ms for most operations
- Database queries: target <100ms
- External API calls: monitor and cache appropriately

**Error Rates:**

- Target <1% error rate for production APIs
- Monitor 4xx vs 5xx errors separately
- Set up alerts for error rate spikes

### System Resources

**CPU Usage:**

- Monitor per-service CPU utilization
- Scale horizontally when >70% sustained usage
- Profile CPU-intensive operations

**Memory Usage:**

- Monitor memory leaks in long-running processes
- Set appropriate memory limits for containers
- Use connection pooling to manage database connections

### Database Monitoring

**Connection Pool:**

```sql
-- Check active connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = 'tripsage';

-- Monitor connection age
SELECT pid, usename, client_addr,
       now() - backend_start as connection_age
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'idle';
```

**Slow Query Analysis:**

```sql
-- Find slow queries
SELECT query, total_exec_time, calls, mean_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Development Environment Issues

### Dependency Problems

**Node Dependencies:**

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

### IDE and Tooling

**TypeScript Issues:**

```bash
# Clear TypeScript cache
rm -rf .next
pnpm build  # Rebuild to check types
```

## Getting Help
