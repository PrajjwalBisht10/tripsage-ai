# SPEC-0017: Attachments & File Uploads Migration (Next.js)

**Version**: 1.1.0
**Status**: Implemented (Phase 1 - Supabase Storage)
**Date**: 2025-12-10

## Overview

- Goal: Replace FastAPI attachments endpoints with Next.js Route Handlers using Supabase Storage for file storage, Supabase Postgres for metadata, MIME/size validation, and stricter rate limits.

**Current Status:** Upload endpoint (`POST /api/chat/attachments`) uploads directly to Supabase Storage with metadata stored in Supabase Postgres. Listing endpoint (`GET /api/attachments/files`) queries Supabase directly with per-user Redis caching and generates signed URLs for secure file access. Legacy backend proxy has been removed. See ADR-0060 and SPEC-0037 for the detailed implementation.

## Routes (Current Implementation)

- `POST /api/chat/attachments` — Uploads files directly to Supabase Storage (bucket: `attachments`). Validates multipart form data with magic byte MIME verification, enforces 10MB per-file cap, max 5 files per request, and rejects requests advertising total payload >50MB via `Content-Length`. Auth is bound to the current Supabase session cookie (`sb-access-token`). Uses `withApiGuards` for auth and rate limiting (`chat:attachments`). Stores file metadata in Supabase `file_attachments` table. Returns signed URLs for secure file access. Revalidates `attachments` cache tag and bumps Redis tag version on success.
- `GET /api/attachments/files` — Queries Supabase `file_attachments` table directly with pagination. Generates batch signed URLs for secure file access and **filters out** items whose signed URL generation fails (schema contract keeps `url` non-nullable). Uses `withApiGuards` with rate limiting (`attachments:files`). Per-user Redis caching with 2-minute TTL. Participates in cache tag invalidation via Upstash tag versioning.

## Routes (Target Implementation - Not Yet Migrated)

- `POST /api/attachments/upload` — Direct Supabase Storage upload (images/pdf only), size cap 10MB.
- `GET /api/attachments` — Direct Supabase query with pagination; cache tags.
- `GET /api/attachments/:id/url` — Short-lived signed URL (viewer-specific) from Supabase Storage.

## Design

- Storage: Supabase Storage bucket `attachments` with RLS via signed URLs.
- Validation: MIME sniff + extension check; reject spoofed types.
- Rate limits: upload 20/min/user, list 20/min/user.
- Observability: spans `attachments.upload`, `attachments.sign`.

### Storage buckets & paths

- Buckets in scope: `attachments` (chat), `trip-images` (itinerary media), `avatars` (profile images).
- Path conventions:
  - Trip-scoped: `trip/{trip_id}/{uuid-filename}`.
  - User-scoped: `user/{user_id}/{uuid-filename}`.
- Relational link: `public.file_attachments.file_path` stores the full object name; unique index on `file_path`.

### RLS & ownership

- Table ownership: `file_attachments` currently stores `user_id` (no `owner_id` column). Table-level RLS enforces `auth.uid() = user_id`.
- Storage bucket RLS handles trip collaboration: path-based rules (`trip/{trip_id}/...`) call `user_has_trip_access()` to allow trip owners/collaborators; user-scoped paths rely on `auth.uid()` matches.
- Signed URL generation and deletion must validate against `file_attachments` and bucket RLS; avoid assuming a separate `owner_id` field.

### Cleanup & audits

- Attachments rely on the relational link for lifecycle; when a message/trip is deleted, delete the corresponding `file_attachments` row and storage object.
- Use the storage owner audit runbook ([Storage Owner Audit](../../operations/runbooks/storage-owner-audit.md)) to find path/owner mismatches or orphaned objects; run after RLS/schema changes.

## Security

- Never store raw URLs; return signed URLs only.
- Verify ownership before signing.
- Sanitize filenames; generate UUID object names.

## Testing

- Multipart parsing (boundary errors, empty parts).
- MIME spoofing detection.
- Oversize rejection with 413; correct `Retry-After` for RL.
- Signed URL TTL and ownership validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All routes SSR-authenticated; no public endpoints.
- Edge-safe for list/sign; Node runtime allowed for multipart if needed.
- Remove FastAPI attachments router and fixtures.
