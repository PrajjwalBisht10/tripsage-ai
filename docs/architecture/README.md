# TripSage System Architecture

> **Target Audience**: Technical architects, senior developers, technical
> stakeholders, integration partners

This section contains high-level system design and architectural
documentation for TripSage. The focus is on system design decisions,
component interactions, and technology stack choices rather than
implementation details.

## Documentation Scope

**Architecture Documentation Includes:**

- System design patterns and architectural decisions
- Component interaction diagrams and data flow
- Technology stack choices and rationale
- Performance architecture and scalability patterns
- Security architecture and access patterns
- Integration architecture with external systems
- Cross-cutting concerns (caching, messaging, storage)

**Architecture Documentation Excludes:**

- Implementation details and code examples → See
  [`docs/development/`](../development/)
- Deployment procedures and operations → See
  [`docs/operations/`](../operations/)
- API specifications and endpoints → See
  [`docs/api/`](../api/)
- Configuration and setup guides → See
  [`docs/configuration/`](../configuration/)

## Architecture Documents

### Core System Architecture

- **[System Overview](system-overview.md)** - Complete system architecture
  with component interactions, data flow, and technology stack
- **[Frontend Architecture](frontend-architecture.md)** - Next.js
  application structure, AI SDK v6 integration, component organization,
  and data flows

### Database & Storage Architecture

- **[Database Architecture](database/)** - Supabase PostgreSQL design, schema patterns, and data models
  - **[Supabase Schema](database/supabase-schema.md)** - Canonical database schema and migration strategy
  - **[Supabase Integration](database/supabase-integration.md)** - Authentication, SSR patterns, and client configurations
  - **[Supabase Operations](database/supabase-operations.md)** - Webhooks, real-time features, and operational patterns
- **[Storage Architecture](storage-architecture.md)** - File storage,
  bucket organization, and security patterns

### Specialized Architecture

- **[Route Exceptions](route-exceptions.md)** - Exception criteria for API
  factory bypass

## Architecture Principles

TripSage follows these core architectural principles:

### 1. **Unified Data Architecture**

Single source of truth with Supabase PostgreSQL, eliminating complex
multi-database patterns while supporting real-time features and vector
operations.

### 2. **Consumer-Aware API Design**

API layer adapts responses and behavior based on consumer type (frontend
applications vs AI agents).

### 3. **Serverless Caching**

Serverless caching with Upstash Redis (HTTP), integrated via Vercel
environment variables, eliminating local cache containers and connection
pooling.

### 4. **Service Consolidation**

Direct SDK integrations replace complex abstraction layers, reducing
latency and improving maintainability while preserving functionality.

### 5. **Real-time Collaboration**

Supabase Realtime-based architecture for live trip planning, agent
status updates, and multi-user collaboration.
