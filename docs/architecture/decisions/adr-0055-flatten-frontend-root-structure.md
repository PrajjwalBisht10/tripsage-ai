## Context

The TripSage repository currently isolates the Next.js application in a top-level `frontend/` directory. All source code, dependencies, and configuration for the app live under `frontend/`, with infrastructure (Supabase, Docker, docs, etc.) at the root. This split originated to separate concerns (and perhaps to allow multi-package expansion), but in practice TripSage is a single application. The indirection adds complexity:

- Developer workflow friction: Contributors must remember to change directory into `frontend/` for nearly every action, for example installing packages, running `pnpm dev`, tests, linting, etc.【2†L75-L83】. Missing this step leads to confusion (for example running commands in root does nothing or operates on a different context).
- Duplicate configuration: Many config files exist in or refer to `frontend/` where a single config at root would suffice. Examples: separate `frontend/package.json`, `frontend/.npmrc`【63†L1-L4】, `frontend/tsconfig.json` (with path aliases), and a root `.nvmrc` and `Makefile` that assume the subdir. This duplication requires coordination, for example Node version is defined in root, but `pnpm-lock.yaml` is inside frontend.
- CI/CD complexity: The GitHub Actions workflows target `frontend` paths explicitly【48†L49-L58】【48†L69-L77】. The deployment (for example Vercel) is likely configured with `frontend` as the project root. These hardcoded references mean any structural change (or a simple oversight in path) can break the pipeline.
- Next.js best practices: Next.js (especially App Router projects) usually reside at the repo root or under a `src/` folder, not an extra monorepo-style folder, unless there are multiple apps. Here we have one app, so the indirection is unnecessary.
- Maintenance overhead: Every update needs to touch both root and `frontend` in some way. For example, Dependabot or version bumps might update root config and frontend separately. Code owners file lists many `frontend/*` patterns【70†L25-L34】 that need mirroring if structure changes. This creates opportunities for inconsistency and increases cognitive load (developers must remember “frontend” prefix everywhere).

In short, the current structure is a remnant of a potential monorepo architecture that is not needed now. Simplifying to a single unified project directory will reduce errors and onboarding time, and make the repository align with community norms.

## Decision

We will flatten the Next.js application structure by moving all contents of `frontend/` to the repository root, establishing a single-package architecture. Concretely:

- The `frontend/src` directory becomes `src` at root. The Next.js app’s entry (`src/app` with all route files) stays the same relative to `src`, just no parent `frontend` folder.
- Config and support files in `frontend/` will be moved or merged into root. For example, `frontend/package.json` becomes the root `package.json`, combining with any root devDependencies if needed. `frontend/tsconfig.json` moves to root (adjusting paths as required).
- Redundant or conflicting files will be resolved. For instance, if a root `README.md` and `frontend/README.md` both exist, they might be merged (likely the root README serves as main documentation, and the frontend README can be folded into it or moved under `docs/`).
- Build and runtime configs will be updated to reflect the new layout:
  - Next.js config (`next.config.ts`) will reside at root. Its settings (like `turbopack.root`) will be reviewed because previously `turbopack.root: "."` pointed to `frontend`. In the new structure `"."` should correctly point to root.
  - Tailwind/PostCSS config: Under Tailwind CSS v4, we have a “CSS-first” approach with minimal config. We will ensure that if a Tailwind config file is needed (even if mostly empty) it is correctly placed at root and that the `content` paths cover `./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}` so Tailwind can find all class usage.
  - Path aliases currently defined in `frontend/tsconfig.json` (like `"@/*": ["src/*"]`, `"@domain/*": ["src/domain/*"]`) remain logically the same. The tsconfig moves location. The baseUrl will be `"."` at root instead of inside frontend.
- Tooling adjustments:
  - CI workflows: Update GitHub Actions YAML to use the repository root as the working directory (remove `working-directory: frontend` everywhere) and change path filters (for example trigger on changes to `src/**` instead of `frontend/**`)【48†L5-L13】【48†L49-L58】. Also, cache keys referencing `frontend/package.json` or lockfile will be changed to the new paths【48†L55-L63】.
  - Code owners: Modify `.github/CODEOWNERS` to replace `/frontend/` patterns with the corresponding root or `src/` patterns (so ownership rules remain effective)【70†L25-L34】【70†L39-L43】.
  - Dev scripts: In `package.json` scripts and any npmrc config, remove assumptions of a subdirectory. For example, the `boundary:check` script will be `node scripts/check-boundaries.mjs` instead of `node ../scripts/...` when run from root【61†L33-L37】. Scripts referencing paths like `frontend/coverage` will be updated to `coverage` at root.
- Documentation: All README and docs references to `cd frontend` or any `frontend/` file paths will be updated to the new locations. The primary README quick start will simplify to a single `pnpm install && pnpm dev` (no subdirectory step)【2†L75-L83】. Architecture docs may remove the extra layer in diagrams or text【2†L125-L133】.

This decision aligns the repository with the one-app reality and modern Next.js project conventions. It eliminates the cost of maintaining parallel structures and reduces potential for mistakes.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Developer efficiency: New contributors can get the app running with fewer steps. The risk of running tests or builds in the wrong directory disappears. IDEs and tools will auto-detect config (TS, ESLint, etc.) more easily at root.
- Simpler CI/CD: One build context means simpler workflows. No need for `working-directory: frontend` hacks. Caching and path globs become straightforward. This reduces maintenance of CI (for example, after this change we will not have to double-list paths or worry about missing a `frontend/` prefix in some script).
- Reduced duplication: With one `package.json` and unified config files, there is a single source of truth for dependencies and settings. For instance, version bumps will happen in one place. Tools like Dependabot or Renovate will operate on one package file.
- Convention alignment: Following standard project structure makes it easier for community members or future hires to navigate the repo. Many assumptions (like “app lives at root/src/app” or “tailwind.config.js is at project root”) will just work, with less special-case knowledge needed.
- Path simplicity: Error messages, stack traces, coverage reports, etc. will be easier to read without the extra directory level. Searching the repo is also a bit easier (one less level to specify).

### Negative / Risks

- Merge conflict risk: This is a large file move. Pending PRs or branches will experience conflicts. We should coordinate this change in a quiet period or communicate clearly so that others pause development or merge in changes beforehand. The ADR being accepted signals everyone to prepare for a one-time disruption.
- Deployment reconfiguration: The Vercel project or whichever deployment target must be updated to use the repository root as the app location. Missing this could break the production deploy until corrected. It is a one-time setup tweak.
- Blame history loss: Moving files will complicate `git blame` history, unless we use tools to trace through renames. We mitigate this by using `git mv` so history is preserved, but in some cases, such as editing lines during the move, attribution could be lost. This is a minor trade-off given the long-term benefits.
- Potential oversights: It is possible to miss an indirect reference to `frontend` in some script, README, or GitHub setting. For example, the release script was referencing `../CHANGELOG.md` from `frontend` context【65†L21-L29】. Such things must be adjusted. A thorough search for `frontend/` will be needed. Even after that, the first pipeline run or local start after refactor will be a crucial test to catch anything missed.
- No immediate user benefit: This refactor does not add features or fix a user-facing bug. It is purely internal improvement. If not managed well, it could introduce a bug. We accept this risk because the long-term velocity and stability improvements justify a short-term pause in feature delivery.

### Neutral

- Repository size and structure: The overall repo contents remain the same, just organized differently. Docker, Supabase, docs, etc. continue to live at root as they do. We are not deleting code, except perhaps obsolete config files, mostly moving. Build output (`.next/`) will now be at root instead of `frontend/.next`, but that is inconsequential outside of CI caching adjustments.
- Tooling config changes: Some config values (paths in tsconfig, etc.) will change, but the behavior should remain the same. For example, path aliases still point to the same code. The team will need to adapt to running commands from root, but that is a return to normal, not a new requirement. This might actually be positive, but we list it as neutral since it is a change in habit.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep `frontend/` structure, refine it

We could retain the `frontend` folder and just improve tooling around it, for example adjust root scripts to proxy commands into `frontend/`, so developers could run `pnpm dev` at root and it would internally do `(cd frontend && pnpm dev)`. This would hide some complexity but not remove it. CI could similarly be tricked to run from root and target frontend.

Why not chosen: This approach is essentially layering more complexity to mask an existing complexity. It does not eliminate the duplication of config or the potential for mismatches, it merely automates some of the steps. It also goes against the grain of typical Next.js projects, meaning new contributors still need to learn our special setup. The maintenance burden of scripts to forward commands is non-trivial and could break in edge cases. Overall, it is a band-aid that fails to address the root issue: the unnecessary extra layer.

### Alternative 2: Multi-Package Monorepo Expansion

Another path considered was to actually justify the `frontend/` directory by expanding the repo into a true monorepo, for example adding a `backend/` service or splitting out libraries. If TripSage were to have multiple deployables, the `frontend` folder could become one of many packages managed via a workspace (pnpm workspaces or Nx, etc.). In that scenario, we would invest in the monorepo tooling and perhaps keep the structure.

Why not chosen: This is currently YAGNI, “You Are Not Gonna Need It”. There is no second app or service in scope. The Next.js app already serves as backend with API routes and frontend. Splitting out further microservices would add complexity and overhead not justified by our scale, and could be hosted separately if needed. Maintaining a monorepo toolchain for a single package makes little sense. If in the future a compelling need for multiple packages arises, we can re-evaluate, but it would likely use a different structure and perhaps a turbo repo or similar. For now, we optimize for the present state, one app.
