-- Attachments: metadata-first uploads + trip-collaboration reads
-- Generated: 2026-01-06
--
-- Goals:
-- - Prevent direct Storage uploads unless a corresponding file_attachments record exists.
-- - Enforce trip edit access when inserting trip-scoped attachments.
-- - Allow trip collaborators to read trip-scoped attachments via metadata.

-- NOTE: Supabase CLI can restore `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` from a cached local backup.
-- If the tracking row for this migration already exists, the CLI will fail at the end when recording
-- the migration version. Make the migration idempotent by deleting any pre-existing row (when present).

-- Storage RLS policies authorize object UPDATE/DELETE by checking for a matching
-- metadata record (file_path = storage.objects.name). If a user could mutate
-- file_path on an existing metadata row, they could repoint it to another
-- object path and gain authorization. Prevent this by making file_path (and
-- other identity fields) immutable for normal requests.
--
-- Notes:
-- - Allow postgres (migrations) and service_role (admin maintenance) to update.
-- - Do not block updating upload_status or attaching chat_message_id; only block
--   changing identifying fields.
