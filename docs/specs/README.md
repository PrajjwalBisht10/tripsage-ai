# Technical Specifications

This directory contains Technical Specifications (Specs) for the TripSage
project. Specs document detailed technical requirements, API contracts, and
implementation guidelines for specific features and components.

## What is a Spec?

A Technical Specification (Spec) is a document that provides detailed technical
requirements, API contracts, implementation details, and testing guidelines for
specific features or components.

## Spec Process

1. **Proposing a new spec**:
   - Create a new file named `XXXX-spec-short-title.md`
   - Fill in the required sections
   - Submit for review via pull request

2. **Spec Lifecycle**:
   - **Draft**: Under development or review
   - **Accepted**: Approved for implementation
   - **Completed**: Successfully implemented
   - **Superseded**: Replaced by another spec

## Directory Layout

- `active/` — Current baseline specifications.
- `archive/` — Historical, completed, accepted, implemented, or superseded specifications (including migrations).

## Creating a New Spec

When creating a new spec:

1. Use the next available number (e.g., if the last spec is 0018, use 0019)
2. Follow the naming convention: `XXXX-spec-short-title.md`
3. Include status, date, and other relevant metadata
4. Link related ADRs and specs in the references section
5. Update this README with the new entry
